# Running the examples

## VS Code Setup
- Install Live Server extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer, to run HTML files with a local server
- Install Prettier extension for code formatting (optional but recommended) 


## Run and debug examples
- Launch html with live-server extension in VS Code
- Click `Inspect` on any element to debug with browser dev tools
- Undock the dev tools to have a better view if needed
- Click on `Sources` tab to see JS files
- Set breakpoints and debug code step by step
- Use `console` tab to run JS commands directly in the browser context
