# Nodejs

## Installing Node.js (and npm)
To install Node.js, follow these steps:
1. Go to the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
4. After installation, you can verify that Node.js is installed by opening your terminal and running:
```bash
node -v
```

## Running a file
To run a JavaScript file using Node.js, you can use the `node` command followed by the file name in your terminal. For example, if you have a file named `app.js`, you can run it like this:
```bash
cd my-bootcamp/13-modules-and-tooling/01-nodejs/code
node app.js
```
